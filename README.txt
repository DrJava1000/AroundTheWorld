My program uses three text files:

Introduction.txt
Rooms.txt
Items.txt

Introduction.txt has no special syntax as it 
serves to only specify the introduction to use
to welcome the player to the game. 

Rooms.txt is formatted in a manner similar to
the pictures in the Mini2 assignment instructions. Every room is entered
in the following manner.

Room ID <single line>
Room Name <single line>
Description <spanning multiple lines>
----
DIRECTION Room ID (between 1-4)
----

The above format doesn't include any empty 
lines below and above. 

Items.txt is done the same way. Though, I added
another line.  

Item ID <single line>
Item Name <single line, no spaces within name>
Item Description <single line>
Room ID <single line>
